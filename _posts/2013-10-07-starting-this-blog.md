According to my experience, most people will try to find the first post in someone's blog... 

Fine, this is it.


### Why I start this blog?

After working as a full-time programmer for more than 2 months, I have learned a lot. One day, I turned on my old SONY laptop and updated the *Evernote*. During the updating, I was surprised to find that I have collected or written 131 notes in about 2 months! These notes are my treasure, and I would like to share these amazing works with you.


### what it would be?

It would be a technical blog, and it will also record my track as a programmer.
